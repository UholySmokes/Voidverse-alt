VOIDVERSE CORE RULES

Ability System:
- Few ability cores (Seeds/Kerne) - these are permanent foundations
- New powers manifest as temporary aspects
- Too many aspects (40+) trigger MANDATORY fusion
- Fusion combines aspects into essence for cores or new aspects
- No "skill trees" - evolution is organic and contextual

Power Acquisition:
- Power comes from USAGE in meaningful contexts
- Power comes from FUSION of accumulated aspects  
- Power comes from CONTEXT (environment, opponents, stakes)
- Power comes from LUCK (mutations, rare synergies)
- NOT from grinding or XP bars

Evolution Principles:
- Weak abilities can evolve into powerful ones through use
- The same core ability appears different in different contexts
- Specificity breeds strength (narrow use > broad use)
- Mutations are unpredictable and permanent
- The Void rewards boldness and punishes hesitation

Fusion Mechanics:
- 40+ aspects = automatic fusion
- Player can manually fuse 2-3 aspects
- Fusion consumes aspects permanently
- Results are semi-random with logic
- Mutations may occur (15% base chance)
- Fusion generates essence for core abilities

Balance Philosophy:
- No "balanced" progression
- Some paths are stronger than others
- Adaptation > optimization
- The system doesn't care about fairness
- Consequences are permanent

Story Integration:
- Abilities must make narrative sense
- Don't allow physics-breaking unless earned
- Environmental limits matter
- Social consequences of power exist
- The world reacts to the player's abilities

WORLD PHYSICS:

Transformation Rules:
- EXTREME transformations need EXPLICIT magical justification:
  * Gender/sex changes
  * Complete identity shifts
  * Species metamorphosis
  * Body restructuring without cause
- VALID magical contexts:
  * Reincarnation/rebirth
  * Bloodline awakening
  * Divine intervention
  * Magical artifacts
  * System evolution events
  * Void energy manipulation
- WITHOUT magical context: Extreme transformations are BLOCKED
- System validates transformation appropriateness
- Most fundamental transformations are PERMANENT

Options Generation Rules:
- Generate EXACTLY 6 options per scene
- Standard distribution: 4 normal + 2 extreme
- NORMAL options (constructive, neutral, social, understandable):
  * Introspection and reflection
  * Sensory exploration
  * Quiet activities
  * Social/adaptive behaviors
- EXTREME options (absurd, dissociative, psychologically unusual):
  * Self-testing/dangerous
  * Trauma-responses
- In escalated scenes: Can be 5:1 or 3:3
- ALL options must fit current context

Content Handling:
- Adult themes (suicidality, violence, self-harm) handled with care
- Never glorify or trivialize sensitive subjects
- Always provide narrative context and respect
- +18 content flagged appropriately
- Emotional states shown through narrative, not UI

Remember:
- Transformations = Need magic
- Options = Always 6, context-appropriate
- Characters = Complex and realistic
